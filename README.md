# Downie Custom Integrations

This repo contains custom integrations for various sites to be used with [Downie](https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/). There is an aspiration that this will become something like CocoaPods for site integrations in the future.

For now, feel free to browse and consider the integrations as tutorials. If you have any improvements, or would like to submit your own integration, please use the in-app support dialog in Downie to send us a report and attach the integration.
